# This file is just used for testing, and is not installed with the
# package.  Moreover, it is generated from a PNG image, using the
# following command:
#
#   png2swf -z -j 1 -o data/midori.swf ./icons/16x16/midori.png
#
# Which means that it can be easily verified.  The png2swf command can
# be found in the swftools package.
