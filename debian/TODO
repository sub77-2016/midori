* Document how to use Firefox plugins.

* Should midori.prerm remove the alternative for $1 = upgrade?

  Scheme48's package does this, but I can't work out where in
  debian-policy or update-alternatives(8) it says if this is right or
  wrong.

* Default home page should not require internet access

  Midori might be run by users who do not have an (active) internet
  connection. For example, they might want to read the ImageMagick
  documentation, which is HTML files in /usr/share/doc/.

  It's confusing for such users to have the default page be stored on
  the internet. This can be alleviated by simply including (and
  installing) an HTML file to be the default home page. The Debian
  Firefox (Iceweasel) packages do this.

* Remove runtime dependency on dbus-launch.

  When building binary packages for Debian, I can either

  - Build without libunique. Then midori works for everyone, but
    running "midori foo" on the command line results in a new midori
    process.

  - Build with libunique. Then midori doesn't start unless there is a
    session dbus, or dbus-launch can be used to create one:

    $ midori; echo $?

    (midori:2128): Unique-DBus-WARNING **: Unable to open a connection
    to the session bus: Failed to execute dbus-launch to autolaunch
    D-Bus session

    (midori:2128): Unique-DBus-WARNING **: Unable to connect to the
    running instance, aborting.

    An instance of Midori is already running but not responding.
    1
    $ env | grep DBUS
    $

  Neither choice particularly appeals to me. Please sort out the code
  so that when built with libunique, midori will fall back to the
  "unique-less" behaviour when there is no session dbus.
