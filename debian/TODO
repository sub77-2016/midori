  When building binary packages for Debian, I can either

  - Build without libunique. Then midori works for everyone, but
    running "midori foo" on the command line results in a new midori
    process.

  - Build with libunique. Then midori doesn't start unless there is a
    session dbus, or dbus-launch can be used to create one:

    $ midori; echo $?

    (midori:2128): Unique-DBus-WARNING **: Unable to open a connection
    to the session bus: Failed to execute dbus-launch to autolaunch
    D-Bus session

    (midori:2128): Unique-DBus-WARNING **: Unable to connect to the
    running instance, aborting.

    An instance of Midori is already running but not responding.
    1
    $ env | grep DBUS
    $

  Neither choice particularly appeals to me. Please sort out the code
  so that when built with libunique, midori will fall back to the
  "unique-less" behaviour when there is no session dbus.
