Some users install a web browser to look at HTML documentation when
they are offline.  In this case, it is not nice to have the default
page be a site that will time out.  Instead, we should use a local
"launch" page, similar to what Konqueror and Iceweasel do already.

Unfortunately there is no generic page of that sort, and I can't be
bothered writing one.  So for now, I will just make the homepage
Midori's user documentation.  This is similar to what Dillo did/does.
