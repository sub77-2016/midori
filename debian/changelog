midori (0.1.6-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * adopt package: set myself as maintainer, remove uploaders, remove dm
    flag (Closes: #528731)
  * rearrange the debian/rules file
  * use xvfb for tests
  * use 'dh --with quilt' for patching instead of including
    /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make

midori (0.1.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #522549).
  * Cherry-pick -fPIC fix from upstream's git and remove previous
    kludge from debian/rules (Closes: #518281).
  * Don't allow linking with incompatibly old libsoup (Closes: #522436).
  * Use new "debug" section for midori-dbg.
  * As Midori is still immature, reduce its priority as an x-www-browser
    alternatives.  Mainly this is to keep Ubuntu's iceweasel users happy.

    Long-term, I should collaborate with the other x-www-browser providers
    to agree on a numbering system (e.g. by popcon popularity).  Currently
    it is as follows:

    20 conkeror, 30 chimera2, 50 dillo, 50 midori, 69 xlinks2,
    70 iceweasel, 70 kazehakase, 85 epiphany-gecko, 100 konqueror,
    100 netsurf, 120 galeon

midori (0.1.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Always use -fPIC. (Closes: #518281).
  * Force rebuild with newer dependencies, to see what happens.
    The next upstream release will require these version bumps anyway.

    * Bump libsoup dependency to 2.25.2.
    * Bump webkit dependency to 1.1 (Closes: #519854, #519123).
    * Bump libunique dependency to 1.0.6 (Closes: #509801).
      Note that 1.0.2 should work: only 1.0.4 is bad.

  * Reintroduce quilt while we wait for the 3.0 source format.
    * Add a Debian search to the default search list (Closes: #520381).
    * Make the homepage a local file.  See patch header for rationale.

  * Use new dh 7.2 "overrides" style.
  * Update copyright file.
  * Remove stale CDBS dependency.
  * Bump standards version to 3.8.1.  No changes necessary.

midori (0.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Use dh(1).
  * New dependency (libidn11-dev) and undependency (libhildon-1-dev).
  * Install /etc/xdg/midori/search.

midori (0.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Trent W. Buck ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #512788).
    Paraphrasing upstream's blog post:

    * Support for bookmarklets (javascript in bookmarks).
    * Links with target=_blank now work (opening a new tab).
    * With recent versions of libsoup and webkit, cookies can persist
      between sessions.
    * Preferences or bookmarks are saved to disk as they are changed.
    * The first time Midori is run after a crash, it will first
      display a "rescue" dialog allowing preferences to be edited or
      scripts disabled.  This is intended for when a script causes
      Midori to crash as it boots, which would otherwise require
      editing config files by hand to fix.
     * Significant speed and capacity improvements to browsing history.
  * Appease lintian regarding various warnings.
  * Update feature list in Description.
  * Make me the Maintainer and William and Uploader.
  * Rewrite manpage.

  [ William Pitcock ]
  * Fix lintian source warnings concerning midori-dbg.
  * Update my e-mail address.

midori (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  From upstream's blog post:

    * Integration of history completion in the location entry.
    * libSoup is used in place of GIO for loading icons, viewing
      sources, saving files, and for the first time icons are actually
      cached on disk.
    * The side panel gained a compact mode to take up considerably
      less space. Bookmarks in the toolbar finally match the menu and
      the panel at any time.
    * The Web Inspector [in] WebKitGtk is now supported.
    * The beginning of unit testing.
    * The ground work for an extension interface has been done,
      extension modules can be written in C at the moment. Bindings to
      Lua and/ or Python are planned for the future. Note that the
      side panel doesn't currently expose the extension management,
      but the Page holder was actually rewritten as one of the example
      extensions.

  * Change build dependency to libsoup (from gvfs and gtksourceview).
  * Rewrite manpage and package description.

midori (0.0.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #497647).
    * control: add new upstream dependencies.
  * control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0 (no changes).  We were
    actually already using the Homepage header field.
  * control, compat, rules: bump debhelper to 7, because I'm a bit
    paranoid about claiming to build with dh4.1.  Fix dh_strip args in
    rules file since the semantics changed in dh5.
  * README.Debian: discuss "missing" icons.
  * control: recommend gnome-icon-theme (Closes: #494061).
  * control: fix homepage link (Closes: #492687).
  * control: provide www-browser (Closes: #476178).
    Not adding www-browser alternative since other X-based browsers seem
    to only set the x-www-browser alternative.
  * watch: fixed.  Upstream tarballs now hosted by XFCE, yay!
  * presubj, install: have users try GtkLauncher before reporting bugs.
  * midori.menu: add (Closes: #466588).
  * midori.install: install .mo and .png files!
  * control: allow DM uploads, since I'll soon be a DM.
