Sometimes a problem in Midori is caused by a bug in the rendering
engine, Webkit.  Please take a moment to try to reproduce bugs with
the Webkit test browser, %GTKLAUNCHER%.
If you are able to reproduce your bug in the Webkit test browser,
report the bug against %LIBWEBKIT_PKG% instead. You may also wish
to see if your bug has already been reported as a webkit bug:
