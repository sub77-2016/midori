Sometimes a problem in Midori is caused by a bug in the rendering
engine, Webkit.  Please take a moment to try to reproduce bugs with
the Webkit test browser, /usr/lib/webkit-1.0/libexec/GtkLauncher.
You may also wish to see if your bug has already been reported
as a webkit bug: http://bugs.debian.org/src:webkit
